Important: Describe your changes and any new methods in the "Changes Description" field, replacing the previous description first (as usual, using SEARCH & REPLACE blocks). If you skip this step, all proposed changes will be discarded because our evolution algorithm depends on it.
It is recommended to write the description in plain language as a short numbered list (avoid long paragraphs and complex symbols), since a different LLM model (or you later) will need to update this text in future calls.
